# Vector-space-word-similarity
You’ll build representations for documents and words based on the bag-of-words model. You’ll implement 2 popular weighting schemes for these vectors: tf-idf and PPMI. Then you’ll compare these weighting schemes on learning word similarity and apply one of them, PPMI, to examine social bias in an NLP corpus.
